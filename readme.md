# Sane
A rails template to reduce some of the repetitive tasks needed to setup a new app.

## How to use

Pass the `-m` flag when creating a new app.

    rails new -m https://raw.github.com/woodall/sane/master/sane_template.rb

## .railsrc

Place the flag into your .railsrc file if you want these to be default

    # ~/.railsrc
    -m https://github.com/woodall/sane/blob/master/sane_template.rb
